 <title>What's New in OpenAM <?eval ${serverDocTargetVersion}?></title>

 <para>OpenAM <?eval ${serverDocTargetVersion}?> fixes a number of issues, and
 provides the following additional features.</para>

 <important>
  <para>This release contains fixes that resolve security issues within
  OpenAM. It is strongly recommended that you update to this release to
  make your deployment more secure, and to take advantage of important
  functional fixes. ForgeRock customers can contact support for help and
  further information.</para>
 </important>

 <itemizedlist>
  <title>Major New Features</title>

  <listitem>
    <para>
     This release uses the new OpenAM Core Token Service (CTS),
     with a more generalized token storage format
     for sessions, SAML Tokens, and OAuth Tokens.

     The LDAP schema have been extended for the CTS objects.
    </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>OpenAM now fully supports OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect 1.0 as well as
   the required building blocks such as WebFinger, and JWT and related emerging
   standards.</para>

   <para>In addition to playing the role of OAuth 2.0 client and resource server,
   OpenAM can play the role of OAuth 2.0 authorization server. See <link
   xlink:href="admin-guide#chap-oauth2" xlink:show="new"
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Managing OAuth
   2.0 Authorization</citetitle></link> for explanations, instructions,
   and examples.</para>

   <para>OpenAM support for OpenID Connect 1.0 extends OAuth 2.0 capabilities so
   clients can verify claims about the identity of the end user, get profile
   information for the end user, and manage end user sessions. OpenAM plays the
   role of OpenID Provider. See <link xlink:href="admin-guide#chap-openid-connect"
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Managing OpenID
   Connect 1.0 Authorization</citetitle></link> for details.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>New, more modern RESTful web services are available for
   authentication, identity management, profile management, session management,
   Integrated Windows Authentication, and more. New endpoints are available
   under the URI <literal>/json</literal> where OpenAM is deployed, and are
   demonstrated in the <citetitle>Developer Guide</citetitle> chapter on <link
   xlink:href="dev-guide#chap-rest" xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"
   xlink:show="new"><citetitle>Using RESTful Web Services</citetitle></link>
   in OpenAM.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>OpenAM adaptive authentication capabilities now include the Device
   Print authentication module (<link xlink:show="new"
   xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-1375"
   >OPENAM-1375</link>). The Device Print module uses characteristics of a
   system, including installed fonts, screen resolution, timezone, and also
   geolocation to uniquely identify the system. The Device Print module
   includes all of the functionality associated with the HOTP authentication
   module.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>OpenAM now supports <link xlink:show="new"
   xlink:href="http://www.openauthentication.org/">Open Authentication</link>
   (OATH, <link xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-727"
   xlink:show="new">OPENAM-727</link>). The module provides the user with a
   one-time password based either on a HMAC one-time password or a time-based
   one-time password. OATH lets you determine which type of one-time password
   is best for your users when they need to login with a password generating
   device. Devices can range from a smartphone to a dedicated device, such as
   YubiKey or any other OATH compliant device.</para>

   <para>With OATH, OpenAM now supports YubiKey authentication. The YubiKey
   simplifies the process of logging in with a One Time Password token as it
   does not require the user to re-type long pass codes from a display device
   into the login field of the computer. The YubiKey is inserted in the USB-port
   of any computer and the OTP is generated and automatically entered with a
   simple touch of a button on the YubiKey, and without the need of any client
   software or drivers.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>OpenAM now fully supports Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) in
   addition to IPv4.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>OpenAM now fully supports Java 7 environments.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>OpenAM Session failover has been modified to be simpler to deploy
   (<link xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-625"
   xlink:show="new">OPENAM-625</link>). OpenAM 10.0.1 and earlier required the
   use of Open Message Queue and Berkeley DB Java Edition, which increased the
   complexity and amount of time required to get session failover working.
   OpenAM now writes session data to the configuration data store instead.
   This implementation also can be used to make sessions persist across restart
   for single OpenAM servers. The current implementation requires that you use
   OpenDJ for the configuration data store.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>OpenAM now includes a preview of the cloud Dashboard service, part of
   allowing user self-management of web based applications. (<link
   xlink:show="new" xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-2019"
   >OPENAM-2019</link>).</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <!-- AME-1652: Update DJ from 2.4.6 to 2.6 -->
   <para>OpenAM now bundles OpenDJ 2.6.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
      <para>
       A new UI is available for experimental, non-production use.

       Informally known as the XUI, this JavaScript based UI uses
       LESS CSS for UI configuration.
      </para>
  </listitem>

 </itemizedlist>

 <itemizedlist>
  <title>Additional New Features</title>

  <listitem>
   <para>The Persistent Cookie module has been added to support configuration of cookie lifetimes,
   based on requests and a maximum time.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>IBM WebSphere 8 is now a supported platform. See <link
   xlink:show="new" xlink:href="install-guide#prepare-ibm-websphere"
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Preparing IBM
   WebSphere</citetitle></link> in the <citetitle>Installation Guide</citetitle>
   for details on how to setup WebSphere 8.0 and 8.5 before deploying
   OpenAM.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>The policy tree index has been updated so that resources first check the root
   level of a realm first. The tree will be created from this level, and any subsequent
   referrals will create another tree specific to the realm where the referral was
   retrieved. This conserves memory and reduces the amount of time required to load
   the tree. An intelligent indexing model now assists with quickly identifying relevant
   policy rules for the resource being authorized.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>The zero page login has been modified so that administrators can disable the
   functionality. The zero page login process is the ability of the user to login
   using only GET parameters, which presents a possible security issue. Zero page 
   login is now disabled by default (<link
   xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-2354"
   xlink:show="new">OPENAM-2354</link>).</para>
  </listitem>

   xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-2765"
   >OPENAM-2765</link>), preventing OpenAM from trying to notify applications
   that are no longer running.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>OpenAM now lets you configure the profile attribute name for email
   used by the password reset module (<link xlink:show="new"

   >OPENAM-2604</link>).</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>OpenAM now provides a mechanism for Identity Providers to use private
   key passwords that differ from the password stored in OpenAM's
   <filename>.keypass</filename> file (<link xlink:show="new"
   xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-2306"
   >OPENAM-2306</link>).</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>OpenAM Java Fedlet <literal>SPACSUtils</literal> can now find the
   <literal>metaAlias</literal> in either the URI or the query string
   parameters (<link xlink:show="new"

   >OPENAM-1826</link>).</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>OpenAM's OATH authentication module's minimum password length is now
   configurable (<link xlink:show="new"
   xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-1765"
   >OPENAM-1765</link>).</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>

   (<link xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-1623"
   xlink:show="new">OPENAM-1623</link>).</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>Legacy naming conventions have been changed to conform to the
   current product name, OpenAM. This includes the OpenAM bootstrap file
   (<link xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-1555"
   xlink:show="new">OPENAM-1555</link>). <filename>$HOME/.openamcfg/</filename>
   is the new name for <filename>$HOME/.openssocfg/</filename>. If you upgrade,
   OpenAM still supports use of <filename>$HOME/.openssocfg/</filename>, and
   does not rename the folder. For new OpenAM installs, OpenAM creates the
   directory with the new name, <filename>$HOME/.openamcfg/</filename>, at
   configuration time. Other files, such as the <filename>openam.war</filename>
   file, and paths have been modified to ensure consistency with the naming
   conventions.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>When running as a Service Provider, OpenAM no longer requires

    <para>You can now prevent OpenAM from caching subject evaluations for
    policy decisions (part of the fix for <link xlink:show="new"
    xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-24"
    >OPENAM-24</link>).</para>
    <para>In most cases you do not need to turn off caching, as OpenAM now
    clears cache when group membership changes. Before turning off caching in
    production, first test the setting to ensure that the performance impact is
